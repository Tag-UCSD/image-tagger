Image Tagger v3.2.14 – Step 14: Guardian + Install-Time Tests

- Hardened install.sh to integrate governance and tests:
  * Guardian:
    - If governance.lock exists, run `python3 scripts/guardian.py verify` and abort
      the install if verification fails.
    - If governance.lock does not exist, run `python3 scripts/guardian.py freeze`
      to create the initial baseline, aborting on failure.
    - If python3 is not available, print a warning and skip Guardian.
  * Tests:
    - After docker-compose brings up the stack, seeding, and existing smoke_api /
      smoke_science checks, run:
          docker-compose exec -T api pytest -q tests/test_v3_api.py
      and abort if the pytest smoketests fail.
- This makes install.sh behave like a mini CI gate: a release that passes Guardian
  + smoke tests + pytest is much closer to "enterprise-ready".
