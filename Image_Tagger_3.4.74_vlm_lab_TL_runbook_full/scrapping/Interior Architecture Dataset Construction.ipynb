    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "This project aims to construct a high-quality, labeled image dataset for fine-grained **interior architectural element recognition**. The goal is to create a clean, labeled dataset for training computer vision models to recognize fine-grained architectural details\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing datasets often label images with broad categories like \"Living Room\" or \"Kitchen.\" However, for architectural analysis, we require a taxonomy that focuses on specific structural details, such as *Coffered Ceilings*, *Clerestory Windows*, or *Vestibules*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, I developed custom scrapers to collect, filter, and normalize data from public sources (**Unsplash** and **Wikimedia Commons**)."

    "### Source A: Unsplash (High-Quality Photography)\n",

    "* **Method**: Official Unsplash API.\n",
    "* **Strategy**: \n",
    "    * Searches for {Keyword} + Interior.\n",
    "    * Filtering: Removes images with \"people\", \"fashion\", \"exterior\" tags.\n",
    "    * Output: High-resolution images with rich photographer metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source B: Wikimedia Commons (Open Knowledge)\n",
    "* **Tool**: `wikimedia_test.py`\n",
    "* **Method**: MediaWiki API\n",
    "* **Strategy**:\n",
    "    * Filtering: Removes images with \"drawings, plans, maps, and ruins\".\n",
    "    * De-duplication: Checks title similarity to avoid downloading burst shots (e.g., \"DSC_01.jpg\", \"DSC_02.jpg\").\n",
    "        * It calculates the text similarity ratio between the incoming title and the list of already downloaded titles.\n",
    "        * A strict SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD of 0.8 is applied. If the similarity score exceeds this limit, the image is automatically discarded to ensure dataset diversity."

    "\n",
    "### 1. Content Blacklisting\n",
    "I filter out images if their metadata contains specific excluded terms. This removes irrelevant data types:\n",
    "* **Non-Photographic**: `drawing`, `sketch`, `plan`, `map`, `diagram`.\n",
