# Science Tag Coverage Map (v1)

Autogenerated by `scripts/generate_tag_coverage.py`.

- Total known feature keys: 145
- Keys with at least one compute implementation: 76
- Stub-allowed keys: 69

## Breakdown by source_type

| source_type | count |
|------------|-------|
| math_or_deterministic | 61 |
| stub_only | 69 |
| stub_total | 69 |
| vlm_cognitive | 1 |
| vlm_semantic | 14 |

## Notes

- `math_or_deterministic`: numeric features computed by the L0/L1 engines
  (e.g., color histograms, texture, fractals, depth/spatial metrics).
- `vlm_cognitive`: high-level cognitive/affective dimensions estimated by
  the CognitiveStateAnalyzer VLM.
- `vlm_semantic`: semantic tags such as style.* and spatial.room_function.*
  estimated by the SemanticTagAnalyzer VLM.
- `stub_only`: keys that are intentionally present in the registry but do
  not yet have a compute implementation; they are tracked by
  `backend/science/feature_stubs.py`.
- `unassigned`: keys that are present in the union of registry/stub/computed
  keys but that currently have no detectable compute implementation and are
  not listed as stubs. In a healthy repository this count should be zero.
  New builds should fail if it drifts above zero.
