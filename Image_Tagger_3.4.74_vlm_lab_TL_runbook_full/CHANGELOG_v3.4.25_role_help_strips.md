# Image Tagger v3.4.25 — Role help strips

This version builds on v3.4.24_tag_inspector_help and focuses on inline, role-specific help:

- Workbench (Tagger Station):
  * Adds a small help strip directly under the existing quick keyboard help.
  * Explains the role of the Workbench (fast YES/NO tagging for images) and how decisions are logged as validations.
- Explorer (Research Discovery):
  * Already included a rich "How to use Explorer" strip; no code changes in this version, but Explorer is now part of the documented role-help pattern.

All existing files from v3.4.24 are preserved; this version is strictly additive.
